# PhD

A (non-exhaustive) collection of programs I wrote during my PhD.

• DKF - Deep Kalman Filter: A machine learning reinterpretation of the Kalman Filter based on the Deep Unfolding technique. Extends applicability of the Kalman Filter beyond traditional settings. Can be used to 1) perform state estimation, 2) fix mismatched model parameters and 3) discover unmodelled dynamics. An ad-hoc regularization process is employed to manage all components of the algorithm. Available in Python and MATLAB. CITE: (TBD).

• DKSVD - Deep K-SVD: An unfolded version of ISTA for image denoising. Available in MATLAB. SOURCE: Deep K-SVD Denoising, https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13164.

• DNMF - Deep NMF: An unfolded (and physics-aware) NMF (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) algorithm for audio source separation and hit detection within general mixtures. Available in MATLAB. CITE: Hit detection in audio mixtures by means of a physics-aware Deep-NMF algorithm, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2024.112162.

• DNMFD - Deep NMFD: An unfolded NMFD (Nonnegative Matrix Factor Deconvolution) algorithm for audio source separation and hit detection within general mixtures. Available in MATLAB. CITE: (TBD).
