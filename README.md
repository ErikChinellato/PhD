# PhD

A (non-exhaustive) collection of programs I wrote during my PhD. Please consider citing these repositories [[1](https://github.com/ErikChinellato),[2](https://github.com/NLALDlab)] or the specific sources included in the following when using the provided code.


â€¢ DKF - Deep Kalman Filter: A machine learning reinterpretation of the Kalman Filter based on the Deep Unfolding technique. Extends applicability of the Kalman Filter beyond traditional settings. Can be used to 1) perform state estimation, 2) fix mismatched model parameters and 3) discover unmodelled dynamics. An ad-hoc regularization process is employed to manage all components of the algorithm. Available in Python and MATLAB. CITE: [ðŸ”—](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2025.102569), [ðŸ”—](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63775-9_22).

â€¢ DNMF - Deep NMF: An unfolded (and physics-aware) NMF (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) algorithm for audio source separation and hit detection within general mixtures. Available in MATLAB. CITE: [ðŸ”—](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2024.112162).

â€¢ DNMFD - Deep NMFD: An unfolded NMFD (Nonnegative Matrix Factor Deconvolution) algorithm for audio source separation and hit detection within general mixtures. Available in MATLAB. CITE: [ðŸ”—](TBD).

â€¢ DKSVD - Deep K-SVD: An unfolded version of ISTA for image denoising. Available in MATLAB. SOURCE: [ðŸ”—](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13164).
